                <h1>Clinical Trials and You</h1>
                <h2>What Are clinical trials?</h2>
                <p>Clinical trials help us learn more about ways to prevent or<br>
                    treat medical conditions. Research must show a study medicine is safe and effective <br>
                    before it can be approved for use. Without these clinical research studies and <br>
                    the volunteers who take part in them, modern medicine would not exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                Researchers are required to follow strict rules to make sure that participants are safe. <br>
                These rules are enforced by the Federal Government. Each clinical trial also follows a careful <br>
                study plan or protocol that describes what the researchers will do. The principal investigator, or <br>head researcher, is responsible for making sure that the protocol is followed.
                </p>
                <h2>Safety in our Reserch</h2>
                <p>We are committed to protecting the people who take part in our clinical trials, and<br>
                    to upholding the highest ethical standards as we seek safe and effective ways to prevent or treat diseases.
                </p>
                <h2>Clinical trial: Benefits</h2>
                <p>You may ask yourself, "Why should I try something that researchers are not sure will work?" <br>
                    That is a good question. Being part of a clinical trial may have risks, but it may also have benefits. <br>
                    Past clinical trial history has led many to hesitate to sign up for research. <br>
                    However, today there are strict rules in place to keep your health and privacy safe.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may get a new treatment for a disease before it is available to everyone.</li>
                    <li>Researchers may provide you with medical care and more frequent health check-ups as part of your treatment.</li>
                    <li>You may have the chance to help others get a better treatment for their health problems in the future.</li>
                    <li>You may be able to get information about support groups and resources.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Clinical Trial: Risks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The new treatment may cause serious side effects or be uncomfortable.</li>
                    <li>The new treatment may not work, or it may not be better than the standard treatment.</li>
                    <li>You may NOT be part of the treatment group (or experimental group) that gets the new treatmentâ€”for example, a new drug or device. Instead, you may be part of the control group, which means you get the standard treatment or a no-treatment placebo.</li>
                    <li>medical appointments could take a lot of time. You might need to travel to the study site several times or stay in the hospital.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Your Rights as a participant</h2>
                <h4>As a participant you have many rights; among them:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may leave a Study at any time</li>
                    <li>Be told the goal of the study</li>
                    <li>Be told all risks and benefits of the study</li>
                    <li>Know who has access to your collected data</li>
                    <li>Have your identity remain confidential and understand your protections</li>
                    <li>Ask about any aspect of study</li>
                </ul>
